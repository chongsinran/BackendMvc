shared_buffers: Allocate a reasonable amount of memory to PostgreSQL (e.g., 25% of total RAM).
work_mem: Set this based on your workload, typically a few MBs.
maintenance_work_mem: Allocate enough memory for maintenance tasks (e.g., vacuuming).
effective_cache_size: Set to approximately 75% of your total RAM.
max_connections: Limit to a reasonable number to avoid excessive context switching.

Scaling a PostgreSQL database involves several steps to ensure it can handle large volumes of data efficiently. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide:

Step 1: Optimize Database Configuration
Tune PostgreSQL Configuration:

Adjust settings in postgresql.conf to optimize performance. Key parameters to consider:
shared_buffers: Allocate a reasonable amount of memory to PostgreSQL (e.g., 25% of total RAM).
work_mem: Set this based on your workload, typically a few MBs.
maintenance_work_mem: Allocate enough memory for maintenance tasks (e.g., vacuuming).
effective_cache_size: Set to approximately 75% of your total RAM.
max_connections: Limit to a reasonable number to avoid excessive context switching.
Enable Connection Pooling:

Use a connection pooler like PgBouncer to manage database connections efficiently.

Step 2: Indexing

Create Indexes:
Analyze your queries and create appropriate indexes. Focus on columns used in WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY clauses.
        CREATE INDEX idx_column_name ON table_name(column_name);

Use Partial Indexes:
Create indexes on a subset of data if your queries often filter on specific conditions.
        CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users (status) WHERE status = 'active';
