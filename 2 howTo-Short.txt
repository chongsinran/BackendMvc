Summary of Steps: (generateFeature.js Scripts will auto generate the file with imported routes boiler plate )

   1. Define the Feature Requirements: Document expected inputs, outputs, and behavior.

   2. Create the Model: Define the data structure and database interactions.

   3. Create the Controller: Handle business logic and interact with the model.

   4. Create the Route: Define the API endpoint and link it to the controller function

   5. Add in middlewares into the routes:
        e.g router.post('/feature',auth, errorFormatter, featureController.handleFeature);

   6. Create the Swagger Documentation: Document the API endpoint.

   7. Update server.js: Import and use the new route and Swagger documentation.
